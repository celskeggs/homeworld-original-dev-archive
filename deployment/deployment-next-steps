for rkt:
	install package

for etcd:
	upload image (in a package, maybe?)

for flannel:
	install package
	include etcdctl in a server package

for kubelet, kube-proxy, kube-apiserver:
	install kubernetes package

for kube-apiserver:
	generate, deploy, and chmod serviceaccount.key (IMPLEMENT shared-key CERTIFICATE DIRECTIVE!)
	set up better authorization with abac or rbac (alwaysallow is not secure)

overall:
	create and install package of deployment folder
	run init-flannel.sh just once
	run start-services.sh on each server
	split start-services.sh up into both a master version and a worker version
	convert things to be based on containers more
	look for other TODOs!

document process:
 * generate configuration
 * deploy configurations
 * generate certificate scripts
 * run certificate scripts
 * install packages
 * someting something start-services.sh
