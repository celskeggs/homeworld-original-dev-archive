for etcd:
	upload image (in a package, maybe?)

for flannel:
	include etcdctl in a server package

overall:
	create and install package of deployment folder
	run init-flannel.sh just once
	run start-services.sh on each server
	convert things to be based on containers more
	look for other TODOs!

document process:
 * generate configuration
 * deploy configurations
 * generate certificate scripts
 * run certificate scripts
 * install packages
 * someting something start-services.sh
